<h1>1D Screen</h1>

<p>To learn how to project 3D environments to a 2D surface, it may help to first imagine projecting a 2D environment to a 1D surface.  Our objective is to illustrate this using interactive diagrams.</p>

<h2>The Standard Projection</h2>

<p>The interactive figure below is a top-down view of how a camera takes a picture (sort of).  The colored circles represent the objects being photographed.  The flat line is the photograph itself.</p>

<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Drag the circles.</p>

<div id="figure1"></div>

<p>This is incidentally how all 3D graphics today are rendered to your 2D screen.  It is the Standard Projection, formally known as the <em>Rectilinear</em> Projection.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, stretching is a nasty side effect of the Standard Projection when used for <em>wide-angle</em> views, and the angle of view must always be less than 180&deg;.  To overcome these limitations we can use another projection.</p>

<h2>The Panorama</h2>

<p>The next figure is a top-down view of how a <em>panoramic</em> camera takes a picture (sort of).  The film is no longer flat, but spherical or cylindrical.  After the picture is taken, we unroll it onto a flat frame.  If we use a cylinder, the projection is formally known as a cylindrical projection.  If we use a sphere, the projection is formally known as equidistant azimuthal projection (or the common fisheye).</p>

<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Drag the circles.</p>

<div id="figure2"></div>

<p>We are able to capture a full 360&deg; range, but without distortion near the margins.</p>

<h2>The Hybrid</h2>

<p>The stereographic projection is a combination of the Standard and Panoramic projections. It combines the range of the Panoramic Projection with the perspective effects of the Standard Projection (increases the size of the objects near the periphery).  The stereographic projection requires two cameras.  The centered camera first projects the image onto the cylinderical or spherical screen, exactly like before.  But instead of <em>unrolling</em> it onto a flat frame, we use a second camera to <em>project</em> it onto a flat frame.  This is known as a Panini projection if we use a cylinder rather than a sphere.</p>

<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Drag the circles.</p>

<div id="figure3"></div>

<h2>Other Projection Methods</h2>

<p>There are hundreds of other projection methods used in cartography and panoramic photography tools.  The aforementioned projections are perhaps the most intuitive to visualize.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>This was originally intended as a supplement to Blinky, a now completed prototype for trying different projections in the context of a game.  It was intended to introduce the concept of projections as intuitively as possible.</p>
